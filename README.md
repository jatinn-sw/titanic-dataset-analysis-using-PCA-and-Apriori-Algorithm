# Titanic Dataset Analysis using PCA and Apriori Algorithm
This project utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the Titanic dataset. <br/>
What is PCA you ask? Well, PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to extract important features while removing redundancy. This allows us to visualize the dataset in 2D space while preserving as much variance as possible.
Here, we will visualize how the PCA-transformed data relates to Survival status of the Passengers. Taking in consideration that the 'Survived' attribute is the target variable
