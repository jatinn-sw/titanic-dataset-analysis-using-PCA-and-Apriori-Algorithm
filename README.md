# Titanic Dataset Analysis using PCA and Apriori Algorithm
### Principal Component Analysis
This analysis utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the Titanic dataset. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that extracts important features while removing redundancy.
This allows us to visualize the dataset in 2D space while preserving as much variance as possible.
Here, we will visualize how the PCA-transformed data relates to the Survival status of the Passengers, taking into consideration that the 'Survived' attribute is the target variable.<br/> 
This analysis uses certain libraries such as: 
- scikit-learn - To perform Principal Component Analysis
- pandas - To read the Titanic dataset, and
- matplotlib.pyplot - To visualize the 2D PCA plot. <br/>
